How to Configure and Use This Script:
Command Lists:

owo_commands: List all commands with a 25-second cooldown. Add or remove commands as needed.
pls_commands: List all Pls commands. Commands "Pls hunt" and "Pls dig" have a 35-second cooldown, while "Pls beg" and "owoz" have a 45-second cooldown.

Cooldowns:

Adjust the cooldown values in the script if needed.
Update the last_owo_times and last_pls_times dictionaries with the desired cooldown values.

Execution:

The script will wait for 5 seconds before starting to allow you to switch to the window where the commands should be sent.
It randomly selects and sends commands while adhering to their cooldowns and prints out the status.
